## What is  Enspiral Services?
Enspiral Services is an Enspiral venture which provides an alternative mechanism outside of traditional agency and hierarchical company structures to encourage and facilitate skilled professionals to work on client projects, individually or in teams. 

Members and contributors work on projects of their choosing, set their own work times, and contribute a small portion (amount of their choosing although we recommend 20%) of their invoicing towards the company. Services funds are allocated by members and contributors through participatory budgeting. 

### Social Enterprise
As a social enterprise Enspiral Services contributes a significant portion of its funds to the Enspiral Foundation which acts as the root node of the Enspiral network. We also directly use our resources and skills to achieve social and environmental impact.

### Ownership Structure
Enspiral Services is a collective using limited liability company with two classes of shares.

*Governance Shares*

These are the shares which control the company. One share per person held by our Members who make decisions about appointing the core team, directors and new members.

*Financial Shares*

There is one financial share in the company which is owned by the Enspiral Foundation so we can flexibly distribute funds towards our social mission.
